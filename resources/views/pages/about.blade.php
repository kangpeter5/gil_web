		    		<p>Thanks for checking out my site. It prides me to bring you this content as it is a culmination of over 16 years of being involved in hip hop, art, and performance. I have reached this level of artistic expression through my hard work while living in Seattle, Hawaii, Los Angeles(present), and in all my travels around the globe and within the United States. </p>
		    		<p>I have taught people of all ages, worked as a cultural ambassador in other countries, danced on TV and in film, and performed on stages of many different sizes. I even toured the US as a stuntman, playing a supervillain in the Marvel Universe Live show. </p>
		    	</div>
		    	<div class="col-md-6">
		    		<p>All of those places I visited, I painted as well. Leaving my mark in the minds of the the audience and my students, and on the various surfaces I acquired for my murals and art. I feel very accomplished and fulfilled at this point, but know that this is only the beginning of a great career. My goal is to manifest a much higher level of expression that speaks to the people, brings joy to their hearts, and fosters balance and communication between opposing polarities. </p>
		    		<p>I am available for projects including dance, acting, stunts, murals, custom art, apparel, caricatures, lettering and much more. Feel free to contact me and let's create something amazing.</p>
